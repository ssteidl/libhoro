<h1>What is libhoro?</h1>

libhoro is a simple cross platform C library that allows developers to easily schedule actions
(callbacks) based on a descriptive cron style string.  The design of libhoro is such that it can
easily integrate into any program event loop.

<h1>What does horo mean?</h1>

Horo is short for horology.  Horology is the study of time.  We thought it would be a clever name.

<h1>Can I see and example of how it works?</h1>

Absolutely.  Below is a short explanation of how to use libhoro. Also, the test program
[/doc/trunk/src/cronprint.c|cronprint.c] is a very simple example of using the libhoro interface.


<verbatim>
dbell_clock_t* clock = NULL;
DBELL_ERROR err = dbell_init(&clock)
</verbatim>
