<h3>What is libhoro?</h3>

libhoro is a simple cross platform C library that allows developers to easily schedule actions
(callbacks) based on a descriptive cron style string.  The design of libhoro is such that it can
easily integrate into any program event loop.

<h3>What does horo mean?</h3>

Horo is short for horology.  Horology is the study of time.  We thought it would be a clever name.

<h3>Can I see and example of how it works?</h3>

Absolutely.  Below is a short explanation of how to use libhoro. Also, the test program
[/doc/trunk/src/cronprint.c|cronprint.c] is a very simple example of using the libhoro interface.

<ol>
  <li> 
    Declare and initialze a dbell pointer.  dbell_init() will allocate memory
    so the dbell_clock_t must be destroyed with dbell_destroy.
    <blockquote><verbatim>
      dbell_clock_t* clock = NULL;
      DBELL_ERROR err = dbell_init(&clock)
    </verbatim></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Declare and implement an action callback which will be executed as
    described in the cron schedule string.  This particular action
    callback prints a timestamp and a string that is passed to the
    callback as actionData.  As shown in the next step, actionData can
    be linked to an action callback when scheduling the action.
    <blockquote><verbatim>
      void printCB(void* actionData)
      {
          time_t rawTime;
          struct tm* timeinfo;

          rawTime = time(NULL);
          timeinfo = localtime(&rawTime);
          fprintf(stdout, "%s: %s\n", asctime(timeinfo), (char*)actionData);
      }
    </verbatim></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Schedule the action using a cron string to describe the schedule.  The 
    following lists describes the parameters to dbell_scheduldeAction()
    <ol>
      <li>
	<strong>clock</strong>: The dbell_clock_t that was created in step 1.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>cron string</strong>: The cron string used to describe the 
	schedule for the action.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>action callback</strong>: The action callback to be executed
	as described by the cron string.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>action data</strong>: A void* pointer that can point to 
	anything.  This pointer will be passed as a parameter to the 
	action callback.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>actionID</strong>: An ID that can be used to unschedule the
	action.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote><verbatim>
      err = dbell_scheduleAction(clock, "*/10 9-14 23 6 *", printCB, "This string is my action data", &actionID);
    </verbatim></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now that the action has been scheduled, the dbell_process()
    function needs to be integrated into the application's main event
    loop.  To keep things simple, libhoro pushes all platform specific
    details onto the integrating application.  libhoro simply requires
    that dbell_process() be called at least 1 time every minute.  This can
    be implemented however the calling application deems fit. <br />
    <ul>
      <li>A Linux application could use timer_fd and select().</li>
      <li>A Win32 application could use SetTimer() in it's main loop.</li>
      <li>A QT based application could use a QTimer.</li>
    </ul> <br />
    No matter how it is integrated, dbell_process() must be called at
    least one time every minute with a dbell_time_t structure that
    contains the current time.  A very simple event loop is shown
    below:
    <blockquote><verbatim>
    while(1)
    {
        /*Retrieve a timestamp.*/
        time_t rawTime = time(NULL);

        /*Break up the time stamp into a timeinfo struct*/
        struct tm* timeinfo = localtime(&rawTime);

        /*dbell_time_t must be filled out with the current time.*/
        dbell_time_t dbellTime;
        dbellTime.minute = timeinfo->tm_min;
        dbellTime.hour = timeinfo->tm_hour;
        dbellTime.dayOfMonth = timeinfo->tm_mday;
        dbellTime.month = timeinfo->tm_mon;
        dbellTime.dayOfWeek = timeinfo->tm_wday;

        /*Will call any necessary actions scheduled for the current dbellTime*/
        err = dbell_process(clock, &dbellTime);
        
        /*Wait until the next minute*/
        delay();
    }
    </verbatim></blockquote>
    <li>
      TODO: Unschedule action.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remember, a dbell_clock_t object that was initialized with dbell_init() 
      must be destroyed with dbell_destroy().
      
    </li>
    <blockquote><verbatim>
	err = dbell_destroy(clock);
    </verbatim></blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>What If My Actions Take Longer Than a Minute?</h3>
I your actions take longer than a minute than they should be executed
in a separate thread.  As previously mentioned, dbell_process() must
be executed at least once per minute.

<h3>What Happens If I Don't Call dbell_process() Every Minute?</h3>
If you don't call dbell_process() in a given minute than any action that
should have been executed in that minute will not be executed. In fact,
if multiple actions are scheduled for the same minute, than they must all
finish within 1 minute or execute in a separate thread.

<h3>Is libdoorbell Thread Safe?</h3>
No, currently flex is used as the cron string lexer which is not thread
safe.  However, actions can certainly spawn their own threads.

<h3>Which Platforms Are Supported?</h3>
Currently Linux and Microsoft Windows.  However, there is plan to
support FreeBSD and other BSDs.  libhoro is written in
C89 so it <strong>should</strong> work on the BSD platforms already, it just
hasn't been thoroughly tested.

<h3>Which Compilers are Supported?</h3>
Currently GCC and Microsoft Visual C.

<h3>How Do I Integrate libhoro Into My Project?</h3>
TODO: Talk about Makefile examples and amalgamation.  Currently no shared lib.

<h3>Is There a Feature RoadMap for libhoro?</h3>
It depends on user feedback, but a rough roadmap is as follows:
<ol>
  <li>
    Add a seconds field to cron strings so that a higher resolution
    schedule is possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add support for month and weekday names.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a syncronous interface.  This implies multi-platform support.
  </li>
</ol>
